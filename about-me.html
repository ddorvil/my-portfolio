	Hi its me, Dominique. Feel free to call me Dom. It's nice to meet you! I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and now live in Rochester attending

I am currently a third year student and double majoring in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies. I have a specific interest in graphic design, digital art, user experience and web/app development. In my free time you can find me painting, posing for the 'gram' and binge-watching shows.
