	  	OVERVIEW
	  </h2>

	  	<p>I wore multiple hats during my internship with Accenture this summer including being a web developer/designer. However, this portfolio is showcasing my work as a UI Designer. My job was to design user interface elements for the web application we were building for our client. Before I started, there were no icons to accompany buttons. But after my job, the icons were there to provide a more stylistic and user friendly experience. The status of this project was shipped meaning that it will be included in the final deliverable for our client.</p>

	  	<h2>PROCESS</h2>
	  	<ul>
	  		<li>First, clearly define the subjects/functions that I will be making icons for.</li>
	  		<li>Sketch ideas based on definition on name of button/function.</li>
	  		<li>Design the icons using Illustrator using colors from the website.</li>
	  		<li>Get critique on progress so far from colleagues and other members of the team</li>
			<li>Work on improving icon from citique</li>
	  		<li>Before exporting, make sure that the icons are transparent.</li>
	  		<li>Get approval from client stakeholders</li>
	  	</ul>

	  	</h2>

	  	<p>I was able to refresh my Illustrator skills by creating these designs from scratch. I also was able to experience real world criticsm where I had to do designs over and over again so that they can meet the design guidlines that the company gave but also to be stylistic. One thing I struggled with was understanding what the icons were being used for so that I can make icons that match their description. For next time, I would redo my 'History' icon because in my opinion it does not match the asthetic of the other icons; but I didn't realize it at the time.</p>
